"""An npc's day for the behavioral model: what it may do in the next hour.

The menu is built from the npc's own routine (`routine` from the game, protocol v6: entries with time, a
ZS_ state and a waypoint) and its habits (a few lines in the persona). Only activities of the routine it
is in now are offered, never its other routine variants: those belong to the story (a ritual, a death).
A choice becomes `start_activity` for an hour; afterwards the routine goes on by itself.

An npc asleep by its routine has nothing to choose; sleep, duty and speeches are never offered, nor the
state it is in now (the engine would only move it, `startState` keeps the old end time) or a waypoint the
others' routines fill at that time.

Two menus come from it (docs/npc-tools.md, wave 2 step 6). The old one (`plan_options`: ids a1/h1 and
their start_activity args) is the one applied while the new one is measured in shadow. The new `do` menu
is a list of DayOption: each has a short key the model reads (keep_routine, a<n>, h<n>, chat, pray,
tavern) and a stable id for traces and training (`routine:<STATE>@<WAYPOINT>`...), and its text says where
and for how long. Its own part is `own_options`; trips to other people and places (daylife.py) go between
keep and these.
